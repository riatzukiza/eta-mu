# Clio

Clio is a small content-addressed event-sourcing kernel for eta-mu.

It treats the immutable event set plus its causal/order graph as authority. A
physical ledger file is only one storage partition of that graph, and a
projection is disposable derived state.

## Laws

1. Committed events are immutable facts.
2. `:event/id` is globally stable identity. Exact duplicate ids dedupe; the same
   id with different data is corruption.
3. `:event/causes` defines causal edges. Every named cause must be present when a
   complete history is canonicalized. Cause ids are unique and an event cannot
   cause itself.
4. `[:event/stream :event/seq]` defines an order-sensitive stream slot. Two
   distinct events claiming the same slot are a concurrent-write conflict.
5. Each stream revision after `1` directly names the previous stream event as a
   cause. This first slice intentionally canonicalizes complete stream histories,
   so sequences are contiguous from `1`.
6. Physical file order and file partitioning have no semantic authority.
7. A projection is a pure fold over the canonical event order and can be deleted
   and reconstructed.

For the same event multiset `E`, arbitrary physical partitions must therefore
obey:

```text
canonicalize(partition-a(E)) = canonicalize(partition-b(E))
project(canonicalize(partition-a(E))) = project(canonicalize(partition-b(E)))
```

Concurrent events in different streams remain unordered by the causal DAG. Clio
uses `[stream-id, stream-seq, event-id]` only as a deterministic replay tie-break
for graph-incomparable events; domain code must not mistake that tie-break for a
causal claim.

## Event shape

There is deliberately no hand-maintained `:event/version` integer.

```clojure
{:event/id "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111"
 :event/schema
 {:schema/root "<sha256 of the complete namespace/schema tree>"
  :schema/id :post/published
  :schema/hash "<sha256 of this schema leaf>"}
 :event/type :post/published
 :event/stream "post:p1"
 :event/seq 1
 :event/causes []
 :event/actor "user:alice"
 :event/subject "post:p1"
 :event/at "2026-08-09T00:00:00.000Z"
 :event/data {:post/id "p1" :text "hello"}}
```

The schema bootstrap is intentionally small: it reveals the schema root, schema
id, leaf hash, and event type. It is a fixed protocol foothold, **not** an
addressable event schema. Once the bootstrap is readable, the exact historical
Malli event schema validates the complete envelope. Because `event-schema`
emits that complete envelope into every catalog leaf, envelope changes also
change event-schema identity automatically.

## Content-derived schema revisions

An event-schema catalog is plain Clojure data mapping qualified schema ids to
Malli forms. `clio.law.schema/event-schema` is a Clojure function you call
while *authoring* that map in code — the CLI's `catalog-file` argument is read
as plain EDN, never evaluated, so a `catalog.edn` file cannot itself contain a
function call. Build the catalog in Clojure/ClojureScript:

```clojure
{:post/published
 (clio.law.schema/event-schema
  :post/published
  [:map {:closed true}
   [:post/id :string]
   [:text :string]])}
```

then serialize the *evaluated* result — the map `event-schema` returns, with
the full envelope already expanded — as what `catalog.edn` actually contains:

```clojure
{:post/published
 [:map {:closed true}
  [:event/id [:string {:min 36 :max 36}]]
  [:event/schema [:map {:closed true}
                  [:schema/root [:string {:min 64 :max 64}]]
                  [:schema/id :keyword]
                  [:schema/hash [:string {:min 64 :max 64}]]]]
  [:event/type [:= :post/published]]
  [:event/stream [:string {:min 1}]]
  [:event/seq [:int {:min 1}]]
  [:event/causes [:vector [:string {:min 36 :max 36}]]]
  [:event/actor [:string {:min 1}]]
  [:event/subject [:string {:min 1}]]
  [:event/at [:string {:min 1}]]
  [:event/data [:map {:closed true} [:post/id :string] [:text :string]]]]}
```

Clio derives a Merkle tree from the **logical namespace hierarchy and schema
forms**, never from source filenames:

```text
root
└── post
    ├── published  -> hash([:schema :post/published <malli-form>])
    └── retracted  -> hash([:schema :post/retracted <malli-form>])
```

Each namespace node hashes its namespace path, schema-leaf hashes, and child-node
hashes. The root hash therefore identifies the complete catalog structure.

When source schemas change, `clio.infra.runtime/open` materializes the new root
and persists the full catalog snapshot under that root automatically. There is no
version constant to remember to bump. Historical snapshots stay readable.

A leaf has its own hash as well as the catalog root. If `:post/retracted` is
unchanged while some unrelated `:dm/message-sent` schema changes, the two catalog
roots differ but the post schema leaf hash remains identical. Clio can therefore
report that an event shape is valid in every **known** catalog revision carrying
that same leaf hash while still requiring the event's recorded source root to be
known and internally consistent. A familiar leaf hash never fabricates an
unknown source revision.

Schemas participating in revision identity must be data-only Malli forms. A
function, JS object, or other runtime identity in a schema is rejected by the
canonical EDN encoder rather than producing an unstable hash.

### Hash-protocol boundary

Schema edits version themselves; the hash protocol cannot recursively version
itself. This first protocol is deliberately fixed to canonical-EDN preimages plus
SHA-256. Changing the canonical encoding or digest algorithm is therefore a
**protocol migration**, not an ordinary schema edit, and must retain a reader for
roots produced by the previous protocol. That boundary is explicit rather than
pretending a Merkle root can identify the rules used to compute itself without a
stable bootstrap convention.

## Namespace construction order

Reusable code follows the repository construction order:

```text
law -> shape -> extern -> domain -> infra
```

- `clio.law.*` — runtime-neutral predicates and invariants, including the
  ledger admission contract (`.cljc`).
- `clio.shape.*` — runtime-neutral Malli/canonical data shapes (`.cljc`).
- `clio.domain.*` — runtime-neutral schema Merkle logic, canonicalization, and
  projection folds (`.cljc`).
- `clio.extern.js.*` — the only Clio namespace family that touches Node/JS
  libraries or builtins. Functions accept Clojure data and return Clojure data;
  Node handles and JS option objects stay inside the boundary (`.cljs`).
- `clio.extern.jvm.*` — JVM filesystem, SHA-256, UUID and wall-clock adapters
  (`.clj`). File channels and kernel locks remain private to this boundary.
- `clio.infra.*` — shared event, ledger, schema-history and projection
  orchestration (`.cljc`), selecting host adapters with reader conditionals.
  The CLI alone remains Node-specific (`.cljs`).
- `bin/*.nbb` and `test/*.nbb` — thin NBB executable entrypoints only.
- `bin/clio.mjs` — the published npm executable. It is a launcher, not logic:
  see [Consuming from npm](#consuming-from-npm).

The shared clj-kondo construction-order hook recognizes `extern`, and Clio
promotes boundary findings to errors. A Clio-specific boundary lint
additionally refuses raw `js/`, `#js`, `js*`, or string host requires in
production source outside `clio.extern.js.*`.

That boundary lint reads *forms*, not text: it parses every source file with
edamame — preserving both branches of a reader conditional and keeping `#js`
as a tagged literal — and reports only reader-level positions. A `js/` sequence
inside a comment, docstring, or string literal performs no interop and is not a
finding, and neither is a quoted symbol: `(def marker 'js/console)` is data,
not host access. (Syntax-quote rides along with that exemption, because
edamame expands it into `quote` leaves this scanner cannot tell apart from a
hand-written one — a documented gap, pinned by a test.) The rules are
runtime-neutral and carry no filesystem access, so they
live in `scripts/clio/lint_extern_boundary.cljc` and the package suite verifies
them on the same three runtimes as the kernel. Directory traversal and the exit
code stay in the Babashka entrypoint, `scripts/lint_extern_boundary.bb`, beside
this repository's other build gates.

Reusable runtime-specific code is `.cljs`, rather than `.nbb`, so the same
namespace implementation can be loaded by NBB and compiled by Shadow CLJS. The
`.nbb` files contain executable wiring, not a second implementation.

## Ledger format

A ledger is newline-delimited EDN:

```clojure
{:event/id "..." ...}
{:event/id "..." ...}
```

This keeps appends genuinely append-only. A complete logical history can be the
union of any number of such ledgers. Exact duplicated events across files are
harmless.

`append-event!` serializes its complete read → validate → collision-check →
append critical section with an **OS-backed advisory lock on the ledger inode
itself**. Every Clio writer participates in this lock protocol; external writers
must take the same advisory lock if they mutate the same ledger. The same locked
file descriptor is used for the read and append. On Unix the authoritative lock
is a blocking whole-file POSIX `fcntl(F_SETLKW)` write lock — advisory, not the
unrelated and effectively dead POSIX *mandatory locking* feature; `flock` is an
additional local-filesystem guard when supported. On Windows the adapter uses
an exclusive `LockFileEx` range covering the file address space. Closing the
descriptor — including process exit or crash — releases the kernel lock, so
Clio has no stale lockfile, lease timeout, PID-reclamation protocol, or
application-level fencing race. Symlink and hard-link aliases therefore contend
on the same underlying file identity rather than on path-derived lock names.

`read-ledger` and each partition snapshot in `read-ledgers` use a read-only
descriptor with a shared lock. On Unix this is a POSIX read lock plus shared
`flock` in Node, or a shared `FileChannel` lock on the JVM. Read-only replay thus
needs no write permission and still waits for participating exclusive writers
to finish. The reader parses through the descriptor that owns its lock, then
releases it. This is a per-file snapshot, not one transaction across files.

Whether a candidate event may join a partition is a law, not transport.
`clio.law.ledger/append-admission` classifies it against the events already
present — `:appendable`, `:already-present`, `:id-collision`, or
`:stream-slot-conflict` — and `clio.infra.ledger` only turns that verdict into
an error or a write. Laws 2 and 4 above are the contract it restates, so a
second ledger transport inherits them instead of reimplementing them.

`append-event!` never brings a ledger into being. The lock open carries no
`O_CREAT`, and the path is checked by name first, so a misspelled, deleted, or
unmounted ledger fails with `:clio.ledger/missing-file` instead of quietly
becoming a fresh empty history while the intended ledger stays behind.
`create-ledger!` — the CLI's `new` — is the only creation path.

A POSIX record lock is released when the process closes *any* descriptor for
that file, not only the one that took the lock. Path-based `read-text` would
therefore drop a held lock silently, so `clio.extern.js.fs` tracks the paths and
exact device/inode identities this process has locked. It refuses path reads
and lock reentry through the same path or an alias before opening another
descriptor; callers inside a critical section use `read-locked-text`.

The JVM adapter uses `FileChannel.lock` on the same existing inode. On Unix
this participates in the Node adapter's authoritative POSIX record-lock
protocol; mixed JVM/Node writers therefore share admission and collision
semantics. An in-process JVM guard serializes descriptor acquisition before
opening files, and refuses path reads through hard-link aliases while locked.
This intentionally trades concurrency for simpler local development behavior.
Filesystems without stable file identity are rejected instead of substituting
path identity, which would make hard-link aliases unsafe.
Both adapters flush appended data (`fsync` / `FileChannel.force`) before
returning success. Atomic rename is required for projection replacement; a
filesystem that cannot provide it fails rather than silently downgrading.

Both schema writers synchronize temporary file contents before atomic rename,
force affected parent directories before and after publication, and persist
newly created directory ancestry. Empty ledger creation also synchronizes its
inode and parent before returning success. This directory durability contract
is supported on Linux filesystems that allow directory synchronization; the
Node adapter uses `fsync` on a read-only directory descriptor and the JVM adapter
uses the default POSIX provider's read-only directory channel.
Unsupported hosts or failed directory forces raise
`:clio.fs/directory-sync-unavailable`; no successful schema publication is
reported. A force failure after the move can leave the new path present, but
the caller still receives failure and must not acknowledge dependent events.
The Node adapter resynchronizes existing ancestry on retry, including directories
left present by a previously refused force. Tests observe real filesystem calls,
inject file and directory synchronization failures, and verify that no dependent
event is admitted. These tests establish syscall sequencing and failure handling;
they do not simulate physical power loss or storage hardware guarantees.

An append can leave its complete event visible even though inode or directory
synchronization failed. `runtime/append!` retains the exact generated event in
the exception data as `:clio/append-recovery`, a map containing `:ledger/path`
(an absolute path) and `:event`. Preserve this EDN if recovery must survive a
process restart. After addressing the underlying failure, explicitly call
`(runtime/retry-append! rt recovery)`. It reloads historical schema revisions
and retries that event without generating another UUID or timestamp. An exact
visible event returns `:already-present` only after validation and both
durability fences succeed. Errors retain the same recovery data and their
original cause; a token does not certify that the event was admitted.

Retries still refuse changed event bytes, competing stream slots, missing
ledgers, unknown schemas and corrupt history. A partially written EDN record
requires explicit investigation; this API does not guess missing bytes or
repair corruption automatically.

`clio.domain.canonicalize/canonicalize` performs:

```text
ledger files
    |
    v
union -> historical-schema validation -> UUID dedupe
    -> missing-parent checks
    -> stream-slot / continuity checks
    -> causal DAG
    -> deterministic topological order
```

The returned DAG preserves parent/child relationships separately from the replay
vector so callers do not have to infer causality from vector adjacency.

## CLI

Installed from npm, the entrypoint is `clio`; inside this repository it is
`nbb bin/clio.nbb`. Every command below is shown in the installed form.

Create an append-only ledger:

```bash
npx clio new events.edn
```

Inspect a catalog's automatically derived revision:

```bash
npx clio schema-root catalog.edn
```

Append an event using a catalog and persistent schema-history directory:

```bash
npx clio append \
  .clio/schemas catalog.edn events-a.edn :counter/opened \
  '{:event/stream "counter:a"
    :event/seq 1
    :event/actor "user:alice"
    :event/subject "counter:a"
    :event/data {:amount 10}}'
```

If append fails after constructing its event, the CLI exits with status 1 and
prints the error plus EDN data to stderr. Pass the **value** of
`:clio/append-recovery` unchanged to the explicit recovery command:

```bash
npx clio retry-append .clio/schemas '<append-recovery-edn>'
```

This command uses the stored historical schema and event identity; it does not
require the current catalog. Failure leaves stdout empty. Success prints the
same `:append/result` and `:event` shape as `append`.

Canonicalize arbitrarily partitioned ledgers:

```bash
npx clio canonicalize \
  .clio/schemas events-a.edn events-b.edn events-c.edn
```

## Consuming from npm

The published tarball is source plus the descriptors needed to build and run
it — `src`, `bin`, `nbb.edn`, `deps.edn`, and this README.

**As a CLI.** `npm install @eta-mu/clio` exposes `clio`. The manifest's bin
target is `bin/clio.mjs`, a Node launcher rather than `bin/clio.nbb` directly,
because npm installs a bin as a symlink in the consumer's `node_modules/.bin`
and nbb discovers `nbb.edn` — and therefore this package's classpath — by
walking up from the script path it is given, without resolving symlinks. The
launcher hands nbb the real entrypoint path and the `nbb` this package depends
on, and inherits the caller's working directory so ledger and catalog arguments
stay relative to the user. Resolving the Malli dependency on first run needs a
JVM available, as it does for any nbb project.

**As a ClojureScript library.** Add the installed `src` tree to your source
paths. `deps.edn` in the package root records the Maven libraries that source
actually requires — the same versions this repository builds and tests against:

| Dependency | Version |
| --- | --- |
| `metosin/malli` | 0.16.4 |
| `borkdude/edamame` | 1.6.42 |
| `funcool/promesa` | 11.0.678 |

Under Shadow CLJS, add them to `:dependencies`; under NBB, note that edamame and
promesa are bundled with nbb, so only Malli needs declaring, as `nbb.edn` shows.

## Consuming from JVM Clojure

Use the same package as a local dependency; there is no second ledger package:

```clojure
{:deps {open-hax/clio {:local/root "../eta-mu/packages/clio"}}}
```

The event, schema-store, ledger, runtime and projection APIs are identical
across JVM Clojure, NBB and compiled Node ClojureScript:

```clojure
(require '[clio.infra.runtime :as runtime]
         '[clio.infra.ledger :as ledger]
         '[clio.law.schema :as schema])

(def catalog
  {:note/recorded
   (schema/event-schema
    :note/recorded
    [:map {:closed true} [:note/id :uuid] [:observed/at 'inst?] [:text :string]])})

(ledger/create-ledger! "events.edn") ; Explicit, exclusive creation; run once.
(def rt (runtime/open ".clio/schemas" catalog))
(runtime/append!
 rt "events.edn" :note/recorded
 {:event/stream "note:1" :event/seq 1 :event/causes []
  :event/actor "developer" :event/subject "note:1"
  :event/data {:note/id #uuid "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-4ccc-8ddd-eeeeeeeeeeee"
               :observed/at #inst "2026-09-11T00:00:00.000Z"
               :text "Recorded locally"}})
(ledger/canonicalize-files (:schema/revisions rt) ["events.edn"])
```

Standard EDN `#uuid` and `#inst` payloads retain their types. Their canonical
forms use lowercase UUID text and signed epoch milliseconds, respectively.
These additions preserve all previously supported values' canonical bytes;
they do not reinterpret an existing hash. The shared instant range is
`1582-10-15T00:00:00.000Z` through `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999Z`, inclusive.
Earlier values encounter the JVM printer's Julian/Gregorian cutover; later years
exceed the common four-digit EDN reader grammar. Admission also checks the exact
tagged print/read round trip. Refused values remain representable as explicit
application strings, but cannot enter an event as canonical instants.
Arbitrary host objects remain invalid.
Keyword and symbol constructors can also produce names that their EDN printer
cannot preserve. Admission requires the printed identifier to read back as
exactly one value of the same kind, namespace and name. Whitespace, delimiters,
reserved symbol literals and ambiguous constructor namespaces are refused
before append; valid identifiers retain their existing canonical bytes. This
also protects generic JavaScript records whose property names become keywords.
Strings and both identifier components must contain Unicode scalar values:
UTF-16 high surrogates require an immediately following low surrogate, and a
low surrogate cannot stand alone. Malformed strings are refused with
`:clio.canonical/invalid-unicode` before hashing or persistence; the error's
`:offset` identifies the malformed code unit. Node and JVM UTF-8 encoders
otherwise replace those units differently. Valid BMP characters, supplementary
pairs and literal replacement characters retain their exact preimages. No
Unicode normalization or lossy replacement is performed.
Malli's data-only predicate symbol `inst?` expresses the instant contract;
`:inst` is not in its default registry. Use quoted symbols in authored schema
code so persisted catalogs contain data rather than runtime function objects.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/clio lint
pnpm --dir packages/clio test
```

The kernel suite runs under NBB, Shadow CLJS and JVM Clojure. The lightweight
Babashka runner (`test/run.bb`) also pins the portable canonical and admission
laws. JVM integration tests start actual NBB peers: each host blocks while
the other owns the ledger inode, a colliding writer observes the committed
winner, and both hosts reproduce identical schema roots and typed projections.
The boundary-lint rules are runtime-neutral and run under all four. Its
partition-invariance
fixture exhaustively checks all 24 permutations of four causally related events
across all `3^4 = 81` assignments to three physical ledgers: 1,944 distinct
physical layouts must converge to the same canonical event-id vector and the same
projection. Separate cases cover duplicated physical copies, schema-root/leaf
version behavior, historical validation, UUID collisions, missing parents,
competing stream revisions, causal cycles, append retry idempotence, and atomic
projection replacement.

The locking tests include real child processes and hard-link aliases: one test
proves a contender blocks while another process holds the inode lock; another
starts colliding appenders through different names for the same inode and proves
that only one stream-slot write commits.

PR-time verification runs in `main-pr-gate.yml`'s `clio` job; there is no
package-local CI receipt file.
