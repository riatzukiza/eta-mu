  "Open an existing ledger and hold an OS-backed exclusive lock on its inode.

   The descriptor stays open for the entire read/validate/append critical

   is killed, or crashes; there is no stale lockfile, lease, PID record,
   reclamation path, or fencing token to race. Hard-link and symlink aliases
   reach the same inode and therefore the same lock.

   Unix uses a whole-file blocking fcntl write lock as the authoritative
   advisory lock, with flock as an additional local-filesystem guard when
   supported. Windows uses an exclusive LockFileEx range covering the full
   file address space.

   Two consequences of the POSIX record lock shape are load-bearing. It is
   released when this process closes *any* descriptor for the file, so every
   read inside the critical section must go through read-locked-text; see
   locked-paths, which refuses the path-based read outright. And the open uses
   the numeric O_APPEND|O_RDWR flags rather than \"a+\": both \"a\" and \"a+\"
   imply O_CREAT, which would let a misspelled or deleted ledger be created
