;;
;; Why it exists: on 2026-08-06 a GitHub-wide Actions outage left every open PR
;; red for reasons unrelated to the code, with no way to answer "would this have
;; passed?" without hand-running each job's commands.

;; Two behaviours are copied from CI because exit codes alone do not capture
;; them: some jobs assert "0 failures, 0 errors" appears in stdout, and some
;; fail on warning diagnostics, including JVM Reflection warning lines.
