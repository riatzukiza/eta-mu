;; Eta-mu test gate.
;;
;; Runs every workspace unit-test suite and reports one summary.
;;
;; This exists because the root `test` script was a four-package `&&` chain
;; (eta-mu, terminal-ui, turn-processor, kanban-legacy). It silently excluded
;; rheos, sol, axxium, chat-ui, protocols, and extensions — which is how
;; @open-hax/protocols sat with two failing assertions nobody saw. ClojureScript
;; is canonical here; the gate has to cover it.
;;
;; Every suite runs even when an earlier one fails, so one red package does not
;; hide the state of the rest. `--bail` opts out.
;;
;;   bb scripts/test.bb [--bail] [--only rheos,sol]
;;
;; Exit 0 when every selected suite passed, 1 otherwise.

   `:label` is what shows in the summary and what `--only` matches. `:pkg` is the

   a package whose failures nobody will see.
