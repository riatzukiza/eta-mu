;; Eta-mu lint gate.
;;
;; Runs clj-kondo across every ClojureScript package, then delegates the
;; TypeScript-era checks to the legacy `scripts/lint.mjs` unchanged.
;;
;; The static gate used to be lint.mjs alone: Biome, tsc, extension path
;; validation, and a kanban frontmatter check — all pointed at legacy
;; TypeScript. ClojureScript is the canonical language here and had zero static
;; coverage in the gate, despite AGENTS.md requiring clj-kondo to pass with zero
;; warnings.
;;
;;   bb scripts/lint.bb [--fix] [--only rheos,sol] [--kondo-only]
;;
;; `--fix` is forwarded to lint.mjs (Biome write mode); clj-kondo has no fix mode.
;;
;; Exit 0 when every check passed, 1 otherwise.
