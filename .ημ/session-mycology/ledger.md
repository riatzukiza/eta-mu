CodeRabbit caught it. Also: the comment --text fix merged in #182 was not in force because eta-mu-beta symlinks to an unrebuilt dist-cli, so the bug reproduced on main and corrupted a card; the receipt claiming it fixed made it less likely to be doubted. Carded the two out-of-scope defects found (build gate rewrites models.generated.ts; merged != shipped for dist-cli).

Two acknowledged plans were falsified by building the artifact — npm bin cannot be a .nbb because npm symlinks bins and nbb walks the unresolved path for nbb.edn; edamame expands syntax-quote into (quote sym) leaves so the quote/syntax-quote distinction does not survive parsing. Both corrected on-thread with evidence rather than silently substituted. Mechanical trap: #280 merged 90s before the last two findings landed, and I committed the receipt onto the deleted branch before cherry-picking it onto #282.

  note: Open-only inventory erased terminal history and turned a stable branch into perpetual intake. Binding terminal evidence to both ref and SHA handles the cheap unchanged case; a serial base comparison handles incorporated or newly divergent heads without an API burst. One accidental root-scoped Vitest invocation demonstrated why package-root commands are the authority in this linked worktree; the correct package suite is 20/20. No new spore; the existing exact-head and worktree-command-scope lessons cover the reusable failure mode.

  note: Post-merge activation review caught an orchestration gap before the unsafe pin landed: a repository-wide comparison rejection could discard unrelated valid work. Separating discovery from per-branch divergence preserves whole-repository progress and records the failed branch without weakening terminal-head or zero-ahead suppression; the CLJS migration inventory now names the extracted boundary and its actual consumers. No new spore; the existing review-thread exact-head and separate-evidence-retention lessons cover the reusable pattern.

  note: The empty-array parser defect was one boundary line, but proving the repair required following the whole-file comment rewrite and every create/update adapter. Kondo exposed a nested deftest that the green compiler run had not executed, and a tracked NUL fixture made its diff binary, so the new cases were isolated in a reviewable text namespace. The repository-wide review hook remains blocked before package builds by managed ignored-build policy; scoped Rheos and eta-mu gates are green and no supply-chain policy was relaxed. No new spore: falsify-every-new-test, worktree-cwd-write-targeting, and verify-the-binary-not-the-source already cover the reusable lessons.

  note: Re-reading the supposedly clean exact-head review exposed an unresolved, valid repository-identity defect before false completion bytes could merge. A fork pull request can share a ref name or ref-and-SHA tuple with a target-repository branch, so repository identity must be part of suppression authority. Canonical P0 child scope-pr-history-to-target-repository now owns the repair; #313 is frozen and #308 remains open. No new spore; the existing review-thread-closeout-verification spore already covers the missed-thread failure mode.

The activation changes only the internal checkout pin, preserves the review card through later consumer proof, and verifies the exact repository/path/credential contract plus the full 25-test GitHub package. Local CLI compilation was bounded by Maven network denial, so hosted exact-head gates remain the authority. No new spore; the existing exact-head and separate-evidence-retention spores already cover this revision topology.

  note: Real portable and compiled consumer failures preceded the pure query correction. Generic equality was unsafe as a numeric NaN guard on a boxed host; numeric equality plus supported vector recursion passes both hosts. Preserving an unexpected subscription failure led to a native FIFO barrier proving a real missed-event startup gap.
