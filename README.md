Canonical eta-mu monorepo.

This repo absorbs the active eta-mu surfaces that were previously scattered across multiple repos and workspace paths, including the former `open-hax/openhax` monorepo. It is a **ClojureScript-first** pnpm workspace: the active code lives in CLJS packages, and the remaining TypeScript is legacy and being migrated.

## TypeScript Deprecation

**TypeScript is DEPRECATED. All new code must be ClojureScript.**



## Charter

- [`kanban/eta-mu-charter-v1.md`](kanban/eta-mu-charter-v1.md) — active working definition of eta-mu core, satellites, and the first living vault.

## Operational Protocols and Extension Adapters

Eta-mu's operational protocols are owned by three sibling packages:

- [`packages/receipt-river`](packages/receipt-river/README.md) — `@eta-mu/receipt-river`
- [`packages/session-mycology`](packages/session-mycology/README.md) — `@eta-mu/session-mycology`
- [`packages/fork-tax`](packages/fork-tax/README.md) — `@eta-mu/fork-tax`

They own their records, schema registries, readers, writers, validators, and
domain projections. The unscoped [`eta-mu`](packages/eta-mu/README.md)
application composes their versions and delegates CLI commands; it does not
carry independent copies of their domain logic.

The eta-mu-extensions package
([`packages/extensions`](packages/extensions/README.md),
`@open-hax/eta-mu-extensions`) still supplies the runtime adapters for the
constitutional layer while migration proceeds. It declares 15 `:local`
extensions in `manifest.edn`, including:

- **receipt-river** — append-only audit ledger for agent decisions
- **session-mycology** — per-turn retrospection with skill-spore incubation
- **contract-runtime** / **contract-runtime-v2** — operational contract fulfillment evaluation
- **opmf-contract-gate** — output-contract gate enforcement

For Receipt River and Session Mycology, these extension implementations are
historical behavior sources and migration adapters, not schema authority.
They remain intact in this first extraction wave and will become thin
delegates after package API parity is complete. The `~/.ημ` directory is the
runtime home (conventionally symlinked to this package's build output). CLJS
sources are under `packages/extensions/src/eta_mu/extensions/`, macros under
`packages/extensions/lib/eta_mu/macros/`, and targets build to
`dist/{pi,opencode,runtime}/`.

```bash
pnpm -C packages/extensions build      # release build to dist/
pnpm -C packages/extensions watch      # dev
```

## Layout

### Active ClojureScript packages

- [`packages/axxium`](packages/axxium/README.md) — `@open-hax/axxium`: axiomatic identity/auth kernel. All-CLJS (shadow-cljs `:esm`/Node) Fastify + Postgres server providing password auth, JWT/cookie sessions, an actor read surface, and an entity read endpoint; intended shared identity provider for proxx/knoxx/openplanner.
- [`packages/chat-ui`](packages/chat-ui/README.md) — `@open-hax/chat-ui`: backend-agnostic Helix/React chat UI components (ChatPanel, MessageBubble, ChatComposer) and the `IChatSession` protocol with sol/knoxx/mock backends; consumed by Rheos via shadow-cljs source path.
- [`packages/contracts/output`](packages/contracts/output) — `@eta-mu/contracts-output`: CLJS output-contract gate (rewrite of `legacy/output-contract-gate`), shipped as a CLI binary and spawned by `eta-mu contracts output`.
- [`packages/eta-mu`](packages/eta-mu/README.md) — `eta-mu`: the global CLI entry point and sub-command router (bins `eta-mu` and `pi`), shadow-cljs `:node-script` bundling the turn-processor agent loop; `npm install -g eta-mu` is the intended install path. **This supersedes `packages/legacy/coding-agent` as the CLI.**
- [`packages/fork-tax`](packages/fork-tax/README.md) — `@eta-mu/fork-tax`: Fork Tax handoff plans, snapshot artifacts, owned/concurrent/blocked classifications, and versioned handoff events.
- [`packages/receipt-river`](packages/receipt-river/README.md) — `@eta-mu/receipt-river`: receipt event construction/validation, historical unversioned compatibility, and provider-independent local repository discovery.
- [`packages/session-mycology`](packages/session-mycology/README.md) — `@eta-mu/session-mycology`: session reflection and lesson events with explicit cross-protocol causal links.
- [`packages/clio`](packages/clio/README.md) — canonical EDN event sourcing kernel, shared schema/admission/replay laws and durable JVM/Node transports. The former standalone `event-ledger` package is retired from active eta-mu dependencies.
- [`packages/extensions`](packages/extensions/README.md) — `@open-hax/eta-mu-extensions`: **canonical** eta-mu constitutional-layer extension runtimes (15 `:local` extensions) compiled to pi/opencode/runtime targets via shadow-cljs. See the Constitutional Layer section above.
- [`packages/e2e`](packages/e2e/README.md) — `@open-hax/eta-mu-e2e`: monorepo-wide end-to-end test harness for cross-package interactions (extension contracts, runtime ↔ coding integration, cross-package seams).
- [`packages/kanban-orchestrator`](packages/kanban-orchestrator/README.md) — `@open-hax/kanban-orchestrator`: kanban board orchestrator agent as contract data only (agent/role/capability/actor + `rheos-kanban` MCP-server EDN); loaded by a knoxx-style runtime, no build step.
- [`packages/katamorph`](packages/katamorph/README.md) — `@open-hax/katamorph`: contract/resource runtime ("data as interpreter") — manifest grammar, Malli schema registry, store protocol + memory/mongo registries, action interpreter, policy engine, and agent-turn utilities.
- [`packages/mcp-contracts`](packages/mcp-contracts/README.md) — `@open-hax/mcp-contracts`: generic CLJS loader that teaches a knoxx-style runtime to accept `:mcp-server` contracts (read from contract roots, returned as gateway server-config); source-only, consumed via source-path.
- [`packages/protocols`](packages/protocols/README.md) — `@open-hax/protocols`: eight CLJS service contracts (EventAdmission/Session/Document/Graph/Translation/Label/User/Realtime) and their compatibility wire envelope. All eight have a Clio-backed EDN provider; Mongo/REST/Socket.IO implementations remain selectable. The legacy raw-envelope EDN adapter remains for existing Rheos board history; Clio owns canonical ledger identity, schema history, admission and replay.
- [`packages/rheos`](packages/rheos/README.md) — `@eta-mu/rheos`: kanban board runtime + service shell. CLJS Fastify/React app (board UI, kanban HTTP/MCP API, FSM-enforced ledger-backed moves) shipping a `rheos` CLI.
- [`packages/sol`](packages/sol/README.md) — `@eta-mu/sol`: eta-mu CLJS agent runtime backend (Node 22 + shadow-cljs + Fastify control plane; `open-hax.sol.*`). Trimmed eta-mu successor of the Knoxx backend; OpenAI-compatible `/v1/*` + `/api/agent/*` + `/ws/stream`, Proxx-backed.
- [`packages/terminal-ui`](packages/terminal-ui) — `@eta-mu/terminal-ui`: CLJS terminal-UI package (rewrite home for `legacy/tui`); the visual counterpart to `turn-processor`, extraction in progress.
- [`packages/turn-processor`](packages/turn-processor) — `@eta-mu/turn-processor`: provider/UI-agnostic CLJS agent turn loop (event-emitting `run-loop`, sequential/parallel tool execution); consumed by the `eta-mu` CLI via shadow-cljs source path.

`packages/sol-staging` is the staging/source tree built via `packages/sol`'s shadow-cljs config (no `package.json` of its own). (The stale `packages/eta-mu-extensions` stub was removed 2026-07-10; the canonical extensions package is `packages/extensions`.)

### Legacy TypeScript packages (`packages/legacy/*`, DEPRECATED)

All of these are slated for CLJS rewrite; see the matching `docs/*-cljs-rewrite-inventory.md`.

- [`packages/legacy/agent`](packages/legacy/agent/README.md) — `@open-hax/eta-mu-agent-core`: stateful agent with tool execution + event streaming (rewrite → CLJS `eta_mu.agent.*`).
- [`packages/legacy/ai`](packages/legacy/ai/README.md) — `@open-hax/eta-mu-ai`: unified LLM API with model discovery + multi-provider config (rewrite target `packages/runtime` `eta_mu.ai.*`).
- [`packages/legacy/coding-agent`](packages/legacy/coding-agent/README.md) — `@open-hax/eta-mu-cli`: coding-agent CLI (bins `eta-mu`/`eta-mu-beta`/`pi`) with read/bash/edit/write tools + session management. **Superseded as the CLI by `packages/eta-mu`** (which owns the same bin names — do not global-install both); retained while the interactive/RPC mode rewrites land.
- [`packages/legacy/docs`](packages/legacy/docs/README.md) — `@open-hax/eta-mu-docs`: ημ docs-indexing library (view-graph substrate) emitting `ημ.docs-index.v1`/`ημ.docs-backlinks.v1` JSONL caches.
- [`packages/legacy/github`](packages/legacy/github/README.md) — `@open-hax/eta-mu-github`: Pi-based GitHub automation bot and PR/issue/mention review gate (octokit).
- [`packages/legacy/kanban`](packages/legacy/kanban/README.md) — `@open-hax/kanban-legacy`: markdown kanban library + `openhax-kanban` CLI (board snapshots, React web UI, Trello/GitHub sync); replaced by `packages/rheos` and the `eta-mu kanban` CLI.
- [`packages/legacy/output-contract-gate`](packages/legacy/output-contract-gate/README.md) — `@open-hax/output-contract-gate`: output-contract gate/validator (remark + edn-data) with an `output-contract-gate` CLI bin; still consumed at runtime by `packages/extensions` via `workspace:*`.
- [`packages/legacy/publication-components`](packages/legacy/publication-components/README.md) — `@open-hax/garden-publication-components`: React "Garden" publication component library (block renderer + music/playlist players, server-render + browser-hydration entrypoints).
- [`packages/legacy/tui`](packages/legacy/tui/README.md) — `@open-hax/eta-mu-tui`: terminal-UI library with differential rendering.

### Config / tooling packages

- [`packages/kondo-config`](packages/kondo-config/README.md) — `@open-hax/kondo-config`: shared clj-kondo config + custom promise-chain hook (`clj-kondo.exports`), consumed by CLJS packages via `:config-paths`.
- `packages/tsconfig` — `@eta-mu/tsconfig`: shared TypeScript base config (`base.json`) for the workspace; consumed by legacy TS packages.

### Clojure & runtime config (repo root)

- `deps.edn` — Clojure dependencies / aliases.
- `ecosystem.config.cjs` / `ecosystem.cljs` — PM2 ecosystem (JS config + CLJS source).

(There is no root `shadow-cljs.edn`; each CLJS package carries its own.)

## Local Commands

Run from the repo root. This is a pnpm workspace — **always use pnpm, never npm.**

```bash
pnpm install:all        # pnpm install across all workspace packages
pnpm build              # pnpm -r --no-bail build (all packages)
pnpm test               # runtime + github + docs + kanban-legacy test suites
pnpm typecheck          # typecheck the remaining TS packages
pnpm lint               # node scripts/lint.mjs
pnpm lint:kondo         # clj-kondo across all packages (--if-present)
pnpm dev                # watch the Rheos package
pnpm start              # start the Rheos package
pnpm hooks:install      # install the pre-commit TS-line-count guard
```

Targeted package work (use the real package names / paths):

```bash
pnpm -C packages/runtime cljs:verify      # compile + cljs-test + smoke + boundary
pnpm -C packages/sol build                # shadow-cljs compile server
pnpm -C packages/extensions build         # build constitutional-layer extensions
pnpm -C packages/rheos test               # rheos test suite
pnpm --filter @open-hax/axxium test       # by package name
```
