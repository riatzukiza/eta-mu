# eta-mu GitHub Automation Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the centralized GitHub automation system owned by `open-hax/eta-mu` and consumed by all `open-hax/*` and `octave-commons/*` repositories.

## Philosophy

- **Centralized logic** lives in `open-hax/eta-mu` packages and reusable workflows
- **Consumer repos** get thin wrapper workflows (10-30 lines each)
- **All repos share** the same behavioral patterns: branch→PR→review→merge→release
- **Review comments block merge** until explicitly resolved by a human
- **Review truth comes from evidence and validation**, not raw model consensus
- **Compatibility projections do not acquire semantic authority** merely because the reviewer can call them

## Reusable Workflows (in `open-hax/eta-mu/.github/workflows/`)

### 1. `ensure-pr-to-staging.yml`
**Purpose**: Automatically create PRs from dangling branches to staging

**Triggers**: Schedule (30min), workflow_dispatch, create
**Inputs**:
- `base`: target branch (default: staging)
- `repo`: repository slug
- `branch-patterns`: comma-separated patterns (default: `fix/*,feat/*,chore/*,docs/*,refactor/*,test/*,perf/*`)

**Logic**: Lists branches matching patterns, filters out branches with existing PRs to base, and creates PRs with inferred titles from branch names.

### 2. `review-resolution-gate.yml`
**Purpose**: Block merge until all review comments are resolved

**Triggers**: PR activity, review submission, review comment creation
**Inputs**:
- `pr`: pull request number
- `strict`: when true, blocks on any unresolved thread (default: true)

**Logic**: Fetches all review threads via GraphQL. In strict mode, it fails if any thread is unresolved.

### 3. `auto-merge.yml`
**Purpose**: Enable GitHub auto-merge when checks pass

**Triggers**: PR opened/ready, check suite completed
**Inputs**:
- `pr`: pull request number
- `merge-method`: MERGE | SQUASH | REBASE (default: SQUASH)

**Logic**: Uses the GitHub GraphQL `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` mutation. It skips PRs that are not open or already have auto-merge enabled.

### 4. `release-and-publish.yml`
**Purpose**: Create a GitHub release and publish to npm on merge to main

**Triggers**: Called by a consumer on PR merge to main
**Inputs**:
- `pr`: merged pull request number
- `tag-prefix`: release tag prefix (default: `v`)
- `create-release`: boolean
- `publish-npm`: boolean (requires `NPM_TOKEN`)

**Logic**:
1. Detect changed packages using `detect-packages`.
2. Create a GitHub release with a timestamp-derived tag.
3. Optionally publish changed packages to npm.

### 5. `opencode-code-review.yml` reference implementation
**Purpose**: Produce a bounded, evidence-first pull-request review with OpenCode and `opencode/mimo-v2.6-flash-free`.

**Triggers**: Non-draft, same-repository pull requests opened, updated, reopened, or marked ready.

**Logic**:
1. Run deterministic dependency, lint, test, and build gates and serialize their exit codes and logs.
2. Check out pinned revisions of `octave-commons/muse` and `riatzukiza/.agents`.
3. Use Muse to compile a review-only OpenCode projection containing observer tools over existing Muse, phase, actor, task, and agent state.
4. Package the compiled tools, source revisions, checksums, and external skill inventory into a review-context artifact.
5. Mount the `.agents` checkout at `~/.agents`, OpenCode's external skill discovery root.
6. Invoke one read-only OpenCode primary agent.
7. Map changed contracts and risk zones.
8. Generate candidate defects and test gaps.
9. Attempt to disprove every candidate.
10. Publish only confirmed changed-line defects meeting the evidence threshold.
11. Keep uncertain questions and test gaps in a non-blocking summary.

The Muse projection intentionally omits write/network-capable multiplexed tools such as `receipt_river`, `edn_ledger`, `session_mycology`, and web search. It also omits actor/agent spawn, actor tell, task execution/control, and phase recording. Observer tools do not make Muse the owner of actor, event, policy, session, or workflow semantics.

The reviewer cannot edit files, browse the web, or spawn subagents. Bash commands are denied except the exact no-op `true`, which retains tool registration without permitting file writes or command chaining. Skills provide process and environment adaptation, but never count as defect evidence. This avoids same-model consensus theater and limits free-tier quota use. The workflow needs no OpenCode credential — `opencode/mimo-v2.6-flash-free` uses the anonymous public-provider path — and disables public session sharing.

The current default pins are explicit inside the workflow so review runs are revision-bound:

- Muse: `0b9a91492c8355e6933dc2164d35668cb76d9e60`
- `.agents`: `7fd3252e7663ad5e68be5e90429d126aa66c38c8`

The reusable workflow accepts repository-specific deterministic gates. Its full-input observer registry includes the immutable diff reader and assessment tools; the companion Muse diagnostic uses the same source revision but compiles the Muse, phase, actor, task, and agent observer subset without the immutable diff reader or assessment tools, so it does not qualify the full review contract or supply approval evidence. Existing callers retain their recorded pin until the new Eta/Muse pair qualifies and merges.

## CLI Commands (in `packages/eta-mu-github`)

### `eta-mu review-gate --repo owner/repo --pr N [--strict]`
Checks for unresolved review threads. With `--strict`, it blocks on all unresolved threads regardless of actor.

### `eta-mu ensure-pr --repo owner/repo --base staging [--pattern fix/*] [--dry-run]`
Creates PRs only for matching branches that have commits ahead of the base and no
open PR. A closed or merged PR suppresses recreation while its recorded head SHA
still matches the branch. Only pull requests whose head repository is the target
repository participate in open or terminal suppression, so a same-named fork head
cannot hide a repository branch. Advancing the branch beyond its terminal head makes
it eligible again when the new head remains ahead of the base. Base-divergence
checks run inside the per-branch processing boundary: a branch with unrelated or
malformed history is reported as an error without preventing another eligible
branch from being projected.

### `eta-mu auto-merge --repo owner/repo --pr N [--merge-method SQUASH]`
Enables GitHub auto-merge via GraphQL API.

### `eta-mu detect-packages --base origin/main [--workspace-glob packages/*/]`
Detects which packages in a monorepo have changed files compared to the base branch.

### `eta-mu release --repo owner/repo --pr N [--tag-prefix v] [--create-release] [--publish-npm]`
Creates a GitHub release and optionally publishes to npm for a merged PR.

## Consumer Repo Wrappers

Each consumer repo gets three or four thin wrapper workflows:

### `ensure-pr-to-staging.yml`
```yaml
on:
  schedule: [cron: "*/30 * * * *"]
  workflow_dispatch:
  create:
jobs:
  ensure-pr:
    if: ${{ github.ref_type == 'branch' && !contains(fromJson('["staging","main","master","production","prod"]'), github.ref_name) || github.event_name != 'create' }}
    uses: open-hax/eta-mu/.github/workflows/ensure-pr-to-staging.yml@main
    with:
      base: staging
    secrets: inherit
```

### `review-resolution-gate.yml`
```yaml
on:
  pull_request: [types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, edited, ready_for_review]]
  pull_request_review: [types: [submitted, dismissed]]
  pull_request_review_comment: [types: [created]]
jobs:
  review-gate:
    uses: open-hax/eta-mu/.github/workflows/review-resolution-gate.yml@main
    with:
      pr: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
      strict: true
    secrets: inherit
```

### `auto-merge.yml`
```yaml
on:
  pull_request: [types: [opened, ready_for_review]]
  check_suite: [types: [completed]]
jobs:
  auto-merge:
    if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.draft == false && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository }}
    uses: open-hax/eta-mu/.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml@main
    with:
      pr: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
      merge-method: SQUASH
    secrets: inherit
```

## Rollout Status

All `open-hax/*` and `octave-commons/*` repos with existing `.github/workflows/` directories have received the three core wrapper workflows:

- axxium, commanoxx, daimoi, depenoxx, eros-eris-field, eros-eris-field-app
- eta-mu-sol, fork_tales, gates-of-aker, lineara_conversation_export, lyrical-engine
- openplanner, privaxxy, promethean, promethean-agent-system, proxx
- shibboleth, simulacron, uxx, vexx

## Remaining Work

### NPM Publishing
The `release` command has a `--publish-npm` flag but the actual per-package `npm publish` logic is not yet implemented. To complete:
1. Detect changed packages.
2. Bump each changed package's version.
3. Run `npm publish` or `pnpm publish` for each package.
4. Handle workspace dependencies and versioning strategy.

### Evidence-review rollout
Before adding thin wrappers to consumer repositories:
1. Run the eta-mu canary against its own review-agent PR.
2. Inspect the deterministic evidence artifact and verify environment failures are not misreported as code defects.
3. Inspect the review-context artifact and verify the pinned Muse and `.agents` revisions, skill inventory, and checksums.
4. Confirm the Muse profile exposes only the intended observer projection.
5. Confirm inline findings attach to changed lines and satisfy the finding contract.
6. Confirm a clean PR produces a short passing summary rather than synthetic criticism.
7. Parameterize deterministic commands for JVM-only, npm, pnpm, and mixed workspaces.

### Branch Protection
For the review gate to block merges, branch protection rules must require the `review-resolution-gate` check to pass before merging.

## Testing

All core logic in `packages/eta-mu-github` has tests:
- `tests/review-gate.test.ts` (4 tests)
- `tests/ensure-pr.test.ts` (3 tests)
- `tests/github.test.ts` (6 tests)
- `tests/event-classifier.test.ts` (3 tests)
- `tests/runtime-batch.test.ts` (3 tests)

Total: 19 tests, all passing.
